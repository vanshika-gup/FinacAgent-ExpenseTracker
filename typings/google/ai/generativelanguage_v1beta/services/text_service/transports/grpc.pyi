    API for using Generative Language Models (GLMs) trained to
    generate text.
    Also known as Large Language Models (LLM)s, these generate text
    given an input prompt from the user.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

            scopes (Optional(Sequence[str])): A list of scopes. This argument is

            channel (Optional[Union[grpc.Channel, Callable[..., grpc.Channel]]]):
                A ``Channel`` instance through which to make calls, or a Callable
                that constructs and returns one. If set to None, ``self.create_channel``
                is used to create the channel. If a Callable is given, it will be called
                with the same arguments as used in ``self.create_channel``.
            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.
                If provided, it overrides the ``host`` argument and tries to create
                a mutual TLS channel with client SSL credentials from
                ``client_cert_source`` or application default SSL credentials.

                Deprecated. A callback to provide client SSL certificate bytes and

                ``api_mtls_endpoint`` is None.
            ssl_channel_credentials (grpc.ChannelCredentials): SSL credentials
                for the grpc channel. It is ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.
            client_cert_source_for_mtls (Optional[Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]]):
                A callback to provide client certificate bytes and private key bytes,

            quota_project_id (Optional[str]): An optional project to use for billing
                and quota.
            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
            always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                be used for service account credentials.
