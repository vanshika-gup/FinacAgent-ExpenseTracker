                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that the ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

                A role is a collection of permitted
                operations that allows users to perform
                specific actions on PaLM API resources.
                To make them available to users, groups,
                or service accounts, you assign roles.
                When you assign a role, you grant
                permissions that the role contains.

                role is a superset of the previous
