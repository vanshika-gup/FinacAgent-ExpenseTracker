    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for DiscussService.

    An API for using Generative Language Models (GLMs) in dialog
    applications.
    Also known as large language models (LLMs), this API provides
    models that are trained for multi-turn dialog.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.
                If provided, it overrides the ``host`` argument and tries to create

                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
