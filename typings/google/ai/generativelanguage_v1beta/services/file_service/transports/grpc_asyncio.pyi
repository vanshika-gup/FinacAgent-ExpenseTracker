            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.
                If provided, it overrides the ``host`` argument and tries to create

            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
            always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                be used for service account credentials.
