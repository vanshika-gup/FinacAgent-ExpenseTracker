class ClientOptions:
    """Client Options used to set options on clients.

    Args:
        api_endpoint (Optional[str]): The desired API endpoint, e.g.,
            compute.googleapis.com
        client_cert_source (Optional[Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]]): A callback
            which returns client certificate bytes and private key bytes both in
            PEM format. ``client_cert_source`` and ``client_encrypted_cert_source``
            are mutually exclusive.
        client_encrypted_cert_source (Optional[Callable[[], Tuple[str, str, bytes]]]):
            A callback which returns client certificate file path, encrypted
            private key file path, and the passphrase bytes.``client_cert_source``
            and ``client_encrypted_cert_source`` are mutually exclusive.
        quota_project_id (Optional[str]): A project name that a client's
            quota belongs to.
        credentials_file (Optional[str]): A path to a file storing credentials.
            ``credentials_file` and ``api_key`` are mutually exclusive.
        scopes (Optional[Sequence[str]]): OAuth access token override scopes.
        api_key (Optional[str]): Google API key. ``credentials_file`` and
            ``api_key`` are mutually exclusive.
        api_audience (Optional[str]): The intended audience for the API calls
            to the service that will be set when using certain 3rd party
            authentication flows. Audience is typically a resource identifier.
            If not set, the service endpoint value will be used as a default.
            An example of a valid ``api_audience`` is: "https://language.googleapis.com".
        universe_domain (Optional[str]): The desired universe domain. This must match
            the one in credentials. If not set, the default universe domain is
            `googleapis.com`. If both `api_endpoint` and `universe_domain` are set,
            then `api_endpoint` is used as the service endpoint. If `api_endpoint` is
            not specified, the format will be `{service}.{universe_domain}`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If both ``client_cert_source`` and ``client_encrypted_cert_source``
            are provided, or both ``credentials_file`` and ``api_key`` are provided.
