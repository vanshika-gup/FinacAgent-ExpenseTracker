class AsyncOperationsRestTransport(OperationsTransport):
    """Asynchronous REST backend transport for Operations.

    Manages async long-running operations with an API service.

    When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be
    designed to return [Operation][google.api_core.operations_v1.Operation] to the
    client, and the client can use this interface to receive the real
    response asynchronously by polling the operation resource, or pass
    the operation resource to another API (such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub
    API) to receive the response. Any API service that returns
    long-running operations should implement the ``Operations``
    interface so developers can have a consistent client experience.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends JSON representations of protocol buffers over HTTP/1.1

                the defaults from operations.proto.  Each method has an entry
                with the corresponding http rules as value.
