"""AWS Credentials and AWS Signature V4 Request Signer.

This module provides credentials to access Google Cloud resources from Amazon
Web Services (AWS) workloads. These credentials are recommended over the
use of service account credentials in AWS as they do not involve the management
of long-live service account private keys.

AWS Credentials are initialized using external_account arguments which are
typically loaded from the external credentials JSON file.

This module also provides a definition for an abstract AWS security credentials supplier.
This supplier can be implemented to return valid AWS security credentials and an AWS region
and used to create AWS credentials. The credentials will then call the
supplier instead of using pre-defined methods such as calling the EC2 metadata endpoints.

This module also provides a basic implementation of the
`AWS Signature Version 4`_ request signing algorithm.

AWS Credentials use serialized signed requests to the
`AWS STS GetCallerIdentity`_ API that can be exchanged for Google access tokens
via the GCP STS endpoint.
