    """An exponential backoff iterator base class.

    Args:
        total_attempts Optional[int]:
            The maximum amount of retries that should happen.
            The default value is 3 attempts.
        initial_wait_seconds Optional[int]:
            The amount of time to sleep in the first backoff. This parameter
            should be in seconds.
            The default value is 1 second.
        randomization_factor Optional[float]:
            The amount of jitter that should be in each backoff. For example,
            a value of 0.1 will introduce a jitter range of 10% to the
            current backoff period.
            The default value is 0.1.
        multiplier Optional[float]:
            The backoff multipler. This adjusts how much each backoff will
            increase. For example a value of 2.0 leads to a 200% backoff
            on each attempt. If the initial_wait is 1.0 it would look like
            this sequence [1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0].
            The default value is 2.0.
