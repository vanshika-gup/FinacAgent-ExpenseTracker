"""JSON Web Tokens

Provides support for creating (encoding) and verifying (decoding) JWTs,
especially JWTs generated and consumed by Google infrastructure.

See `rfc7519`_ for more details on JWTs.

To encode a JWT use :func:`encode`::

    from google.auth import crypt
    from google.auth import jwt

    signer = crypt.Signer(private_key)
    payload = {'some': 'payload'}
    encoded = jwt.encode(signer, payload)

To decode a JWT and verify claims use :func:`decode`::

    claims = jwt.decode(encoded, certs=public_certs)

You can also skip verification::

    claims = jwt.decode(encoded, verify=False)

    """Credentials that use a JWT as the bearer token.

    These credentials require an "audience" claim. This claim identifies the
    intended recipient of the bearer token.

    The constructor arguments determine the claims for the JWT that is
    sent with requests. Usually, you'll construct these credentials with
    one of the helper constructors as shown in the next section.

    To create JWT credentials using a Google service account private key
    JSON file::

        audience = 'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/google.pubsub.v1.Publisher'
        credentials = jwt.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            'service-account.json',
            audience=audience)

    If you already have the service account file loaded and parsed::

        service_account_info = json.load(open('service_account.json'))
        credentials = jwt.Credentials.from_service_account_info(
            service_account_info,
            audience=audience)

    Both helper methods pass on arguments to the constructor, so you can
    specify the JWT claims::

        credentials = jwt.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            'service-account.json',
            audience=audience,
            additional_claims={'meta': 'data'})

    You can also construct the credentials directly if you have a
    :class:`~google.auth.crypt.Signer` instance::

        credentials = jwt.Credentials(
            signer,
            issuer='your-issuer',
            subject='your-subject',
            audience=audience)

    The claims are considered immutable. If you want to modify the claims,
    you can easily create another instance using :meth:`with_claims`::

        new_audience = (
            'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber')
        new_credentials = credentials.with_claims(audience=new_audience)
