This module provides authentication for applications where local credentials

This class can be used to impersonate a service account as long as the original
Credential object has the "Service Account Token Creator" role on the target
service account.

    """This module defines impersonated credentials which are essentially
    impersonated identities.

    Impersonated Credentials allows credentials issued to a user or
    service account to impersonate another. The target service account must
    grant the originating credential principal the
    `Service Account Token Creator`_ IAM role:

    For more information about Token Creator IAM role and
    IAMCredentials API, see
    `Creating Short-Lived Service Account Credentials`_.

    .. _Creating Short-Lived Service Account Credentials:
        https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-short-lived-service-account-credentials

    Usage:

    First grant source_credentials the `Service Account Token Creator`
    role on the target account to impersonate.   In this example, the
    service account represented by svc_account.json has the
    token creator role on
    `impersonated-account@_project_.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

    Enable the IAMCredentials API on the source project:
    `gcloud services enable iamcredentials.googleapis.com`.

    Initialize a source credential which does not have access to
    list bucket::

        from google.oauth2 import service_account

        target_scopes = [
            'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only']

        source_credentials = (
            service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
                '/path/to/svc_account.json',
                scopes=target_scopes))

    Now use the source credentials to acquire credentials to impersonate
    another service account::

        from google.auth import impersonated_credentials

        target_credentials = impersonated_credentials.Credentials(
          source_credentials=source_credentials,
          target_principal='impersonated-account@_project_.iam.gserviceaccount.com',
          target_scopes = target_scopes,
          lifetime=500)

    Resource access is granted::

        client = storage.Client(credentials=target_credentials)
        buckets = client.list_buckets(project='your_project')
        for bucket in buckets:
          print(bucket.name)

        Args:
            source_credentials (google.auth.Credentials): The source credential
                used as to acquire the impersonated credentials.
            target_principal (str): The service account to impersonate.
            target_scopes (Sequence[str]): Scopes to request during the
                authorization grant.
            delegates (Sequence[str]): The chained list of delegates required
                to grant the final access_token.  If set, the sequence of
                identities must have "Service Account Token Creator" capability
                granted to the prceeding identity.  For example, if set to
                [serviceAccountB, serviceAccountC], the source_credential
                must have the Token Creator role on serviceAccountB.
                serviceAccountB must have the Token Creator on
                serviceAccountC.
                Finally, C must have Token Creator on target_principal.
                If left unset, source_credential must have that role on
                target_principal.
            lifetime (int): Number of seconds the delegated credential should
                be valid for (upto 3600).
            quota_project_id (Optional[str]): The project ID used for quota and billing.
                This project may be different from the project used to
                create the credentials.
            iam_endpoint_override (Optiona[str]): The full IAM endpoint override
                with the target_principal embedded. This is useful when supporting
                impersonation with regional endpoints.
